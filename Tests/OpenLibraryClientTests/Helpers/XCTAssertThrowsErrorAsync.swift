import XCTest

/// Asserts that an asynchronous expression throws an error.
/// This function serves as an asynchronous counterpart to `XCTAssertThrowsError`,
/// allowing you to test that an asynchronous expression results in an error.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
///     await XCTAssertThrowsErrorAsync(
///         try await sut.method()
///     ) { error in
///         XCTAssertEqual(error as? SomeError, SomeError.specificError)
///     }
/// ```
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - expression: An asynchronous expression that is expected to throw an error.
///   - message: An optional description to display if the assertion fails. This can help
///     provide more context about the failure.
///   - file: The file in which the failure occurs. By default, this is set to the filename
///     of the test case where this function is called.
///   - line: The line number on which the failure occurs. By default, this is set to the line
///     number where this function is called.
///   - errorHandler: An optional closure to handle the error thrown by the expression.
///     This allows you to perform additional assertions or actions based on the specific error.
